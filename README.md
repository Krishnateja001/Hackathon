## Project Description
Developing a decision-making model for MBTA commuters by allowing users to determine their optimal commute strategy. Users can make informed decisions by considering factors such as 
	MBTA crowding levels based on season and average commute on the day
	The availability of Uber or Lyft 
	Predicted prices 
 This model empowers users to select the most suitable commuting option based on crowd conditions, timing, and cost-efficiency.
