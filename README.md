## Project Description
Developing a decision-making model for MBTA commuters by allowing users to determine their optimal commute strategy. Users can make informed decisions by considering factors such as 
	MBTA crowding levels based on season and average commute on the day
	The availability of Uber or Lyft 
	Predicted prices 
 This model empowers users to select the most suitable commuting option based on crowd conditions, timing, and cost-efficiency.


## How to setup
	git clone : https://github.com/YeshaswiniVasudev/Hackathon.git
	python3 -m venv venv
	pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Use case
- MBTA : Select the MBTA line to know the expected crowd level
- Cab : Select the Source and Destination address to compare the predicted prices on Uber and Lyft
- Diffusion: We just wanted to explore diffusion. It has no specific use case with respect to our project.
